# Test-Project
This is a project to show i'm confident with python/django.

## The task
>Imagine a pizza ordering services with following functionality:

>- Order pizza . Order data: pizza id, pizza size (30cm/50cm), customer name, customer address (just plain text)
>- Update order
>- Remove order
>- See a list of customer orders

>Tasks:

>1. Design Model/DB structure
>2. Design and implement API with Django (Rest) Framework for the described web service. Please note:
>	-  You don’t have to take care about authentication etc, we are just interested in structure and data modelling.
>	-  You don’t have to implement any UI, just the API endpoints
>3. Write test(s) for at least one of these endpoint(s)

>After you are done, push your code to a public repository and send us a link.

## Things I would have done differently for production
- definitely implement authorization and authentication
- Use webpack to have only one JS-File and manage all the different versions of the frameworks
- The models, because normally I would make it more complex, for example: add an address model to customer etc.
